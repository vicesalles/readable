# REDEABLE

## WHAT

This is a React-Redux project part of my React nano-degree at Udacity. With this project I'm testing my Redux learnings and consolidating my React experience. Using fetch instead of xhr or jquery is also a novelty to me.

## USAGE

It needs a simple dummy server to work. Server can be found here: [node dummy server]

After installing and set up running the server, just follow the next steps with this app:

1) NPM INSTALL
2) NPM RUN

(yarn also works as this has been created with the create-react-app starter)
