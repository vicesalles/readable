# REDEABLE

## WHAT

This is a React-Redux project part of my React nano-degree at Udacity. With this project I'm testing my Redux learnings and consolidating my React experience. Using fetch instead of xhr or jquery is also a novelty to me.

## USAGE

It needs a simple dummy server to work. Server can be found here: [node dummy server]

After installing and set up running the server, just follow the next steps with this app:

1) ENTER APP FOLTER AND RUN NPM INSTALL
2) ENTER SERVER FOLDER RUN NPM INSTALL
3) START THE SERVER NPM START
4) START THE APP NPM START

UI folder contains static Bootstrap materials

(yarn also works as this has been created with the create-react-app starter)
